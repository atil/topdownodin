+ gameobjects with arbitrary shapes

Gameplay
+ make the thing look at the cursor
+ add size to gameobject
+ fix: gameobject points being in global space
+ cursor visual
- then here 2: draw debug circles for visible corners
- implement visibility calculations
- have some obstacles around
- implement character collision: circle collider would feel better
- implement character movement: accel/decel

- raylib custom shader for quads
- raylib postprocess shader 

Util/editor

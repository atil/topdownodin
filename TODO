Core
+ assets database struct, add other textures
+ import math queries and write unit tests
+ line-line intersection unit tests
+ gameobjects with arbitrary shapes

Gameplay
+ make the thing look at the cursor
+ add size to gameobject
+ fix: gameobject points being in global space
+ cursor visual
+ draw debug circles for visible corners
- implement visibility calculations
- have some obstacles around
- implement character collision: circle collider would feel better
- implement character movement: accel/decel

Render
- raylib custom shader for quads
- raylib postprocess shader 

Util/editor
- draw grid
- json: gameobject positions & corners
+ debug draw: to be drawn on top of everything else.
+ debug draw: circle

Environment
- [on hold] odinfmt: prints to console?
- odin.vim amme hizmeti: add built-in functions like append (https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin/wiki/Built-in-Procedures)
X (not worth it at the moment) try vim-bujo for todos
+ reduce raylib log level
+ move to an actual folder and create a git repository
+ gitignore .exe files. "odin test" creates an exe file in the root folder and we can't specify the path

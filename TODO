Core
+ assets database struct, add other textures
+ import math queries and write unit tests
+ gameobjects with arbitrary shapes

Gameplay
+ make the thing look at the cursor
+ add size to gameobject
+ fix: gameobject points being in global space
- implement visibility calculations
- have some obstacles around
- implement character collision: circle collider would feel better
- implement character movement: accel/decel

Render
- raylib postprocess shader 

Util/editor
- draw grid
- json: gameobject positions & corners
- start from here: debug draw: needs to be drawn on top of everything else. also, see @HERE

Environment
- [on hold] odinfmt: prints to console?
- odin.vim amme hizmeti: add built-in functions like append (https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin/wiki/Built-in-Procedures)
- try vim-bujo for todos
- reduce raylib log level
+ move to an actual folder and create a git repository
